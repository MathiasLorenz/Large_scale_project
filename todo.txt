Things that must be done:

( - : Not done, + : Done. )
+ Fix non rectangular grids. Not sure if it is correct.
+ Check that FLOP is counted over all timed functions.
- Write report with simple cases and indexing.
+ In MPI test 1, consider the fail cases when allocating arrays.
+ In MPI init 1, remember hi is incorrect. Make the computation general.
- In MPI jacobi 1, we need to handle tolerances via broadcast or similar.
- In jacobi util, we need to change how we handle h's and steps.
+ Sendrecv doesn't work with -oversubscribe, test if it works when submitted.
- Consider how we time execution and corresponding FLOP(s).

- Remember to consider the error is not decreasing as fast for big systems.
- What is our baseline tests? omp, mpi_1, cuda?
- Consider if specific kernels can be waited for.
