# Large scale project
This large scale project is an implementation of the Jacobi method for solving 
steady-state partial differential equations. The implementation is based on 
OpenMP, openMPI and CUDA to test the performance gains of using parallel
technology for finding the steady-state solution to a partial differential
equation.
In out implementation we have tested the program with a simple heat equation
using a sinusodial function as our source. 
The repository is containing all source code along with shell and matlab files
which can be used to test the implementation.

## Folder structure
The repository contains two folders, 
- Poisson 
	- 	Contains all files needed for compiling the program including 
		a makefile and a readme describing the functionalyty of the 
		program in depth.
- Testing
	- 	Containg shell scripts and matlab code used for testing and visualizing
		the results of the program.
- Additional files used by us for streamlining the development process of the 
  project.

### Prerequisites
In order to compile and run the code the following libraries must be available: 
(the versions specified in paranthesis is the tested versions)
- GCC	( 6.3.0 built with OpenMP suport )
- MPI   ( openMPI 2.1.0 )
- CUDA  ( 9.1 )

### Installing
The poisson folder should be readily usable by the make utility. Please examine
the makefile before compiling to check for compliation flags and compilers. 

## Running the tests
For direct usage of the jacobiSolver in the commandline is described in the 
readme located in the Poisson folder. This describes the functionality in 
depth.
The test scripts located in Testing/shell is designed to run on the LSF based
cluster at the Technical University of Denmark. Please modify these in order to
use them elsewhere. 
No additional packages are needed in order to run the matlab code used in the 
visualization.
