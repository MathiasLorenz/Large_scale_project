How to setup a test with name XXX:
- Use submitmflop.sh as templates to create the file submitXXX.sh.
- In submitXXX.sh change LSB variables to fit the test needed. Change the jobname "LSB -J " to XXX.
- In the subroutine "Program" change the code between the dashed lines to the test that should be done.
- The data needed for plots in matlab should be saved as .dat files.
- In submit.sh, add the test XXX to the list of tests.

All matlab plot functions called by the submitted test should be named "matlabXXX.m"
All matlab plot functions should have 2 inputs. Data path and Figure path.
If matlabmflop.m is used as a template this should be trivially defined

To run the tests use submit.sh and write which tests you want to run.
